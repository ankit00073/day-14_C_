**Timer with Start, Stop, and Reset Functionality**<br>
**Overview**<br>
This project implements a timer with start, stop, and reset functionality using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The timer is displayed on a web page with three buttons: Start, Stop, and Reset. The user can click the buttons to control the timer.<br>
<br>
**HTML**<br>
The HTML structure includes a timer container div, a timer display element with the timer id, and three buttons (Start, Stop, Reset) with corresponding ids and classes.<br>
<br>
**CSS**<br>
The CSS file (styles.css) styles the timer container, timer display, and buttons. It provides a clean and visually appealing interface with hover effects on the buttons.<br>
<br>
**JavaScript**<br>
The JavaScript code manages the timer functionality.<br>
It initializes variables to keep track of start time, elapsed time, and the timer interval.<br>
The startTimer function is triggered when the user clicks the "Start" button. It calculates the elapsed time and updates the timer display every 10 milliseconds.<br>
The formatTime function formats the elapsed time into hours, minutes, seconds, and milliseconds.<br>
The stopTimer function stops the timer by clearing the interval and re-enables the "Start" button.<br>
The resetTimer function resets the timer by clearing the interval, setting the elapsed time to 0, and displaying "00:00:00.00". It also re-enables the "Start" button.<br>
<br>
**How to Use**<br>
Open the index.html file in a web browser.<br>
You will see the timer displayed at the top, along with the "Start," "Stop," and "Reset" buttons.<br>
Click the "Start" button to begin the timer. It will start counting up.<br>
Click the "Stop" button to pause the timer. You can click "Start" again to resume from where it left off.<br>
Click the "Reset" button to reset the timer to 00:00:00.00.<br>
